# Reimpl-Transformer-pytorch

This is a direct reimplementation of the work done in [this repository](https://github.com/dreamgonfly/Transformer-pytorch).

I am reimplementing to walk through and have a better understanding of the inner workings of 
transformers. I added comments to places where I had questions and "that's a cool trick" moments. I also
did some refactoring in some places where I felt necessary.
